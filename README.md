# Daily-Life-Management-System
Course Name: Project Work I.
Code Code: CSE 150.
Project Title: Daily Life Management System.
# Introduction:
A daily life management system is a software application that helps users to organize and
manage their daily tasks. This can include tasks such as:
1. Show time and routine work for every hour.
2. Show the next work before 10 minutes.
3. Setting priorities for tasks for every hour
4. Setting and tracking goals.
5. Make a routine Set Time for 24 hours.
6. update routine when needed.
7. Set Password for updating.
# Project Overview:
This project will be implemented in c and C++, users can use features that are mentioned in the
introduction part. A team will cover the project with 3 members.
# Project Requirements
The following software and hardware are required to develop the daily life management system:
1. A C++ compiler.
2. A text editor.
3. A computer with a C++ development environment.
# Project Design
The daily life management system will be designed using a simple C++ programming language.
This means that the system will be implemented by if-else statements, loops, simple data
structure and algorithm or dividing into objects if needed.
Each object will have its own data and methods. The data represents the object's state, while
the methods represent the actions the object can perform. For example, a task object will have
data for the task name and performing time/deadline. The task object will also have methods for
replacing, editing and deleting the task.
# Features:

 2.  Current task show if have any with done or not 
 3.  Upcoming task show if have any. 
 4.  Adding Task under different topic. 
 5.  Immediate Marking done current task. 
 1.  Just Mark 
 2.  Mark and Delete the task 
 6.  Finance Manager. 
 1.  Add Income with income source 
 2.  Add Expense with expense details 
 3.  View balance with details 
 7.  BMI 
 1.  Calculate BMI. 
 2.  Show BMI catagory. 
 3.  Show previous days weight. 
 8.  Note 
 1.  See note

 3.  Clear note 
 9.  Todays Task History 
 10.  Show all task 
 11.  Mark any Task that added. 
 12.  Delete a task 
 13.  Delete all task 
 14.  Adding a topic 
 15.  Print task(in Topic) 
 16.  Todays summary(as topic wise spend hour) 
 17.  show, set or clear History(Summary)
# Project Testing
The daily life management system will be tested by creating test cases that cover all of the
system's functionality. The test cases will be executed to ensure the system works correctly.
# Project Conclusion
The daily life management system is a simple but useful application that can help users to
organize and manage their daily tasks. The system is easy to use and can be customized to
meet the individual needs of each user.
